Version 0.6beta1 user visible changes:

 - Feldhell TX works. Full international character set support.

 - All modems have their own config dialog. Clicking the mode
   label in the statusbar opens the dialog for the current mode.
   (RTTY and THROB squelch and Feldhell AGC settings don't work yet.)

 - Help file. This is still work in progress. Specifically the
   section about usage is mostly bogus right now.

 - TX text is handled a bit differently now. Difficult to explain,
   please test...

 - Locator entry in QSO data (also sent to remote log).

 - MFSK pictures.

 - The FFT library (FFTW) now uses "wisdom" to optimize CPU consumption.
   User will notice that the first time a modem is used, there will be
   a few seconds delay.

 - Hamlib (rig control) support.
